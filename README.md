# Study Dashboard

Dashboard designed and tuned for the **TU Delft Bachelor's** grade system. Copy your grades onto the `Courses` sheet and let the magic happen. 

## Introduction

At some point in my Bachelor's I realized I could do with an effective way to

1. Visually inspect my progress
3. Plan my study and set my goals
2. Get a fair estimate of how much I must study (especially daily) to achieve my goals

It turned out to be a cool project to learn Excel.
